#Depatrment Billing Syste


Descrpiton:
  It is a team project based on an online departmental store billing system. My role in the project is billing.
  In a real store, customers pick the products they need and go to the cashier counter for billing. Similarly, in our system, users can select the products they want and add them to the cart.
  The system provides basic functions such as add, delete, and payment. When the user clicks on Payment, they are taken to the receipt page. 
  The receipt shows the date, payment details, and allows the user to choose their payment method — cash, UPI, or card. 
  Once the payment is successful, the receipt is generated.ard when the payment is successful the recipt is generated 

To run the project :
    open the xampp control panel , start the apache and MySql
    go to the brower , Type localhost/projectname or /particular file name (eg.localhost/login.php
